## Macromolecular (Maribor) Density and Structure Analysis plugin



## Description
MADE plugin is a PyMOL GUI tool that applies the multiple different superposition algorithm for identification and prediction of non-protein species in macromolecular complexes. We have show that the plugin is capable of identifiyng metal ions in their binding sites in *apo* protein structures. 

The MADE plugin can be applied for numerous purposes. It can predict locations where important cofactors bind in a protein structure and distinguish them from species that are present as impurities or part of the experimental procedure. The plugin can also be applied to structures modeled by AlphaFold and predict the positions of cofactors in those structures. In addition, the plugin can highlight important pieces of a binding site, such as conserved water or other molecules, and help prepare structures for molecular docking or molecular dynamics simulations.

It is based upon the ProBiS H2O plugin (http://insilab.org/probis-h2o/) for detecting conserved water molecules.

## Installation

The MADE plugin is suppported on the Windows and Linux operating systems.

MADE plugin requires the PyMOL (https://pymol.org/) molecular visualization system, the Open-Source PyMOL is available free of charge. Installation instructions can be found on the PyMOL wiki: 

https://pymolwiki.org/index.php/Windows_Install

https://pymolwiki.org/index.php/Linux_Install

MADE plugin also requires the scikit-learn python library (https://scikit-learn.org/), it can be installed though pythons' pip:

    pip install scikit-learn

With PyMOL and scikit-learn installed, install the MADE plugin in the plugins tab of PyMOL:
- Navigate to **Plugin -> Plugin Manager -> Install New Plugin -> Install from local file** and select the **MADE_Plugin.py** file
- Upon first startup of the plugin input location of the **.MADE_Plugin** directory, 
- Selecet a **Local Database Directory** and press **Setup database** in the Settings tab

For a more detailed explanation of the installation and usage of the MADE plugin consult the tutorial pdf.


To reinstall the plugin either delete the .MADE_plugin directory or the .MADE_plugin_installdir.txt file in your home folder and launch the plugin again.
