# Superposition algorithms in MADE plugin


The following superposition methods are included in MADE:
- ProBiS
- GANGSTA+
- DeepAlign
- TM-align

The Windows executables/Linux binaries are present in this repository, they are automatically downloaded by the plugin. Below are links to the original repositories and relevant articles. Accessed April 2022.
Source codes for the superposition algorithoms are also included in the Source_codes directory
